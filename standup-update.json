Today Ulbricht returned to court to face a panel of judges to appeal his conviction\u2014but it was his harsh sentence that seemed to most draw their focus. In oral arguments in a Manhattan courtroom Thursday morning, Ulbricht\u2019s defense lawyer sparred with federal prosecutors over a range of issues, including the credibility of evidence, the role of two corrupt agents in the investigation, and the defense\u2019s blocked attempt to call two expert witnesses to testify on Ulbricht\u2019s behalf. But the defense seemed to elicit the most sympathy from the three-judge panel when it attacked Ulbricht\u2019s life sentence after he was convicted for drug trafficking, money laundering, and leading an organized criminal enterprise. In particular, the judges criticized a portion of the sentencing hearing in which  parents of Silk Road buyers who had died of drug overdoses were called to testify. That testimony \u201cput an extraordinary thumb on the scale that shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d argued appellate judge Gerald Lynch. He went on to call the sentence \u201cquite a leap.\u201d  \u201cDoes this [testimony] create an enormous emotional overload for something that\u2019s effectively present in every heroin case?\u201d Lynch asked at one point. \u201cWhy does this guy get a life sentence?\u201d When federal judge Katherine Forrest handed down Ulbricht\u2019s controversial life sentence last year for crimes that are usually considered nonviolent, she justified it in part by pointing to six fatal overdoses prosecutors had tied to Silk Road, calling Ulbricht\u2019s creation of the site\u2014which sold crack cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and other drugs\u2014\u201cterribly destructive.\u201d  But Forrest also pointed to evidence brought forward at trial that Ulbricht had paid to have six people killed, including a former employee and a blackmailer. None of the murders was carried out, nor was Ulbricht charged in connection with the schemes; instead, they appear to have been faked to scam Ulbricht, or in one case spoofed by a law enforcement sting operation. Nonetheless, in Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing  hearing, Forrest argued, \u201cThere is ample and unambiguous evidence that [Ulbricht] commissioned\u2026murders to protect his commercial enterprise.\u201d Ulbricht\u2019s defense reiterated in the appeal hearing today that none of the alleged murder plots had actual victims. \u201cWe have no evidence they even occurred,\u201d Ulbricht\u2019s lead defense attorney Joshua Dratel said. \u201cWhy does it matter if they happened or not?\u201d Lynch responded. \u201cThe crimes of which the defendant was convicted carried a life sentence, did they not?\u201d Dratel responded that murder-for-hire typically carries a ten-year sentence not life. \u201cMurderers don\u2019t get life sentences,\u201d Dratel said. \u201cPeople who actually commit murder.\u201d The prosecution, for its part, defended the inclusion of the alleged murder plots in Ulbrict\u2019s sentencing hearing, as well as the testimony about overdose victims. \u201cThis is unprecedented, the amount of drugs, the amount of harm,\u201d said prosecutor Eun Young Choi. The appelate panel was less sympathetic to the defense\u2019s arguments that evidence in the trial had been tampered with by two corrupt federal agents, one employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the other by the Secret Service. The agents stole bitcoins from the Silk Road, sold law enforcement information to Ulbricht, and attempted to extort him. \u201cHow is this material exculpatory?\u201d Lynch asked, pointing out that there was no sign the agents had tampered with information on the Silk Road\u2019s server. The prosecution followed up on that point, arguing that none of the evidence in the trial had come from the two agents. When the defense protested that they hadn\u2019t been allowed to bring forward an expert witness to talk about the possibility that Ulbricht\u2019s laptop had been hacked to plant evidence, Lynch quickly rebutted the point. \u201cThe jury didn\u2019t know in this day and age that computers can be hacked?\u201d he asked. \u201cEven the NSA gets hacked.\u201d Ulbricht\u2019s defense seemed to have more success when it focused on his sentencing, pointing out that life without parole went beyond even the prosecution\u2019s request that the judge impose a sentence \u201csubstantially above the mandatory minimum.\u201d In fact, the Southern District of New York, where Ulbricht\u2019s trial occurred, has a reputation for relatively lenient sentencing, with around 75 percent of cases receiving less than federal sentencing guidelines. All of that seems to suggest that if Ulbricht has any chance of a new trial, it may not come from attacking the judicial process or the evidence that convicted him. Instead, his last hope of escaping a lifetime in prison may come from the severity of the sentence itself.","redirectionUrl":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/10\/judges-question-ulbrichts-life-sentence-silk-road-appeal\/","art":{"attribution":"AP","images":[{"height":500,"width":500,"url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Ulbricht_HP_AP_748136603732-500x500-e1475777459789.jpg"}]}}]
